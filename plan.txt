Combination: usability testing tasks carried out in field testing.

Usability Testing:

2 test groups - old non gamers and young gamers
controlled setting - home and pub
observation on users' performance
record time of completion of a task
errors that accour during the completion of a task
number of navigations to online help or manuals
number of users making a particular error
number of users completing a task successfully
5-6 participants per group?

pros:
-	uninterrupted - can assess performance, identify
	errors and help explain why users did what they did.
-	can use in conjunction with satisfaction questionnaires
	and interviews to elicit user opinions.
	
cons:
-	controlled settings are artificial and lack context.
	Users were asked to play the game.
-	requires skill to determine typical users and typical tasks.
-	time to set up tests, recruit, participants and run tests.
-	need access to resources/equipment.

Field Studies:

natural settings

do the people look like they are enjoying the interaction?
are there any distruption to the tasks?
satisfaction/enjoyment of overall experience?
follow up on interesting observations - ask why something happened.
clarification where an event or activity was unclear.
ask for examples to back up general points.
give the participant a chance to say anything else they want.

pros:
-	helps understand what users do naturally and how technology
	impacts them in context.
-	evaluating in real usage is the only way of finding out
	whether a design has been successful in its aims

cons:
-	access to settings.
-	lack of control, noise, distractions
-	hard to capture detail of usability
